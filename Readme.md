# EVM station

## Introduction

CosmWasm is a smart contracting platform built to be secure, flexible, and interoperable with other chains. It's built on the Cosmos SDK and makes use of the Wasm (WebAssembly) format for smart contracts. This allows developers to write contracts in Rust or other languages that compile to Wasm, thus enhancing the developer's experience and broadening the base of potential contract developers
